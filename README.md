# PCA and LDA Classification (Python & R)

This repository contains implementations of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction and classification using both Python and R.

## 🔍 Dataset

- **Source**: UCI Wine Dataset
- **Features**: 13 chemical attributes of wine
- **Target**: Wine class (3 categories)

## 📁 Files

### Python
- `pca_classification.py` – PCA followed by Logistic Regression
- `lda_classification.py` – LDA followed by Logistic Regression

### R
- `pca_classification.R` – PCA followed by SVM classification
- `lda_classification.R` – LDA followed by SVM classification

## 📦 Libraries Used

### Python
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
- `sklearn`: PCA, LDA, StandardScaler, LogisticRegression, ConfusionMatrix

### R
- `caTools`, `e1071`, `MASS`, `kernlab`

## 📊 Visualizations

Both training and test sets are visualized using decision boundaries to show class separation after dimensionality reduction.
